## Introduction
In the past 2 classes, we installed all the necessary modules for the Python class and wrote the on_ready function, which made the bot online.
We installed the necessary modules and made the bot echo messages. Today, we will write mute, kick, and ban commands.
The Discord API has things to mute, kick, and ban.

## Lesson Content
In this lesson, we will write the mute, kick, and ban commands.
The mute command is done by assigning a muted role to a user.
The kick and ban commands have built in functions that make them work.
We can also have the bot DM users when they are punished and say who punished them so they could appeal.
We will also set a custom prefix for the bot.
The homework is to finish the mute, kick, and ban commands and set a prefix for the bot.
